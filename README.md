# Memory App

This is a simple single player memory game built with Vue. The project was done in course of the Hypermedia and UX lecture. It has two modes "Time Limit" and "Flip Limit". The images for the memory cards will be fetched from this [Cat API](https://developers.thecatapi.com/view-account/ylX4blBYT9FaoVd6OhvR?report=bOoHBz-8t).
